# WeightedLinearRegression.java

Implements weighted linear regression in Java.

This code is a direct Java port of the C# code posted in [An Algorithm for Weighted Linear Regression](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/25335/An-Algorithm-for-Weighted-Linear-Regression) by Dr. Walt Fair, PE.

Note that this code uses a matrix inversion method, so will be subject to numerical instability and/or failure under some circumstances.
